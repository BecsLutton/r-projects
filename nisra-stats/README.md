# **NISRA Stats**

This repo contains data from the NISRA website, in specific data related to the NICEI 2022 data found in [this publication](https://www.nisra.gov.uk/system/files/statistics/NICEI%20Q4%202022%20factsheet.PDF); more specifically the data contained within the Growth Rates panel. If the link is ever broken, a pdf version of the publication is in this repo

There are 2 folders in this repo: 
 
 - scripts
 - markdown
 
### **Scripts**
This folder contains all the data and the 3 scripts required to generate the plots in the publication. Each script is commented to provide clarity on tools/techniques chosen
 
### **Markdown**
The markdown folder contains the documents required to compile an HTML file (also available in pdf) that better guides the reader through the generation of the images in the publication. Unlike the scripts folder, this document combines all code into one document as opposed to 3 individual scripts. Commented code is a bare minimum and is an excellent resource but I tend to find I respond better to a markdown-style document that breaks up the visuals into chunks.

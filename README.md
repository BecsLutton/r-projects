# R-based projects

This is a repository collating projects I have completed in past as well as trialing R features and/or data manipulation techniques that are new to me or that I have been wanting to use. 
It currently contains 3 folders:

 - nisra-stats
 - masters-project
 - ODNI
 
 These folders each contain some R scripts and/or data files to be used with R for data analysis purposes.

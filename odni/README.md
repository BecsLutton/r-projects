This repo contains the files being used in commercial work with Open Data NI and Farming Carbon.
The goal of the project is 3-fold:

 1. Provide farmers with farming-related chemical data associated with their county, and more precisely their farmland.
 2. Provide local councils with data relating to their council area, inclusive of farmland soil, water run-off and soil sediment data
 3. Provide public engagement sessions in each county disseminating the analysis completed and the ramifications in relation to areas of agricultural risk and current farming practices. 
 
 
This data is a pre-cursor to more detailed analysis planned in the future using specialised sensors installed in participating farmers' land to provide the farmers access to precision agriculture on the road to the government's net zero 2050 goals. 

As an output there will be interactive datasets implemented using R's Shiny and a dashboard which, may well be an R Flex Dashboard hosted in GitHub Pages. 
This is to provide an MVP of what can be done with data currently available; to give farmers and local councils access to processed, easily understood data relating to global warming and the impact farming is having on that. 

The datasets are combination of many csv files of data collected during the last government soil, sediment and water surveys, farming census data, areas of agricultural risk (generated by DAERA) and the NI postcode data; there are also GeoJson files which will assist in the spatial mappiing element of the project.
